Tests:
- You don't have to aim for 100% code coverage, but we'd love to see your skill in this field. So please test at least one feature. You can use Jest + enzyme/react-resting-library for this. [`I failed setting-up tests for redux-connected components, If you'd be so kind to send me some resources, so I can learn to test my redux apps correctly, I'd be very grateful`]

### Notes

I didn't use TS cuz I'm still learining using it, It'd take much more time to get this task done and I've been overloaded with work recently.
